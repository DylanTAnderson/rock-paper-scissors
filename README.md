Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is my first individual project, initially the game can be run in the console.
In the future I hope to create a GUI to play the game, as I learn more about
Javascript fundamentals I will revisit this project and improve on my first iteration.
I am planning to refactor as needed and use my future knowledge to build upon this project.
